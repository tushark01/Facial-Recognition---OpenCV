#Simple Face Recognition algorithm using Python and OpenCV

# Inspiration:
http://utpcc.blogspot.com/2017/05/facial-recognition-machine-learning.html

## Requirement
- Python 3.10.1 (i used)
- `pip install opencv-contrib-python`

## Outline
This project consist of 3 parts, which are:
1. Creating datasets (face_datasets.py)
2. Train the model (training.py)
3. Face Recognition (face_recognition.py)

## How to run ?
1. Run `python face_datasets.py` to create datasets
2. Run `python training.py` to train the model
3. Run `python face_recognition.py` to recognize the face
